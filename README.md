# Personal Blog Repository

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog built with:

- [**Jigsaw**](https://jigsaw.tighten.com/) - Static site generator for Laravel
- **Blade** - Templating engine for dynamic layouts
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Laravel Mix** - Asset compilation and bundling

## Structure

- `source/` - Contains all blog content and templates
  - `_layouts/` - Main layout templates
  - `_assets/` - Raw CSS/JS assets
  - `assets/` - Built assets (generated)
  - `index.blade.php` - Homepage template
- Configuration files for Jigsaw, Tailwind, and Mix

This blog serves as my personal space for sharing thoughts, projects, and technical insights.
